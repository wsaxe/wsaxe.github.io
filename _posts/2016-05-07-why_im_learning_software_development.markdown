title:  Why I'm Learning Software Development

 Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Uber, Slack - All of these are household names which 10 years ago did not exist (or were a shadow of their current selves). It's obvious that these companies all have great software at their core, but are these the only types of companies that need great software to accomplish their goals? Again, it's obvious that this is not the case. If you haven't noticed, software is "eating the world" as one expert has said. Take a look at the top 20 publicly held companies by market cap (in Millions) as of the end of 2015:

6 of the top 20 companies are exclusivly focused on software, and can you think of a single company on this list that doesn't need to have custom software developed in order to meet their goals?

So we can conclude that software is here to stay, and therefore the need for software development is only going to expand, touching ever more industries and fields that it previously did not. This in itself is a great reason to learn software development. But is this my reason? Not exactly. 

My reason and my inspiration to start on this journey comes from a single comic that laid out a life philosophy to aspire to. It comes from [SMBC Comics](http://www.smbc-comics.com/):

I can't say that I've followed the exact time line laid out here, but for the last 6 years, I have perfected a certain skill set, and I believe at some point, as humans, we need to step out of our comfort zone and try something completely different. I believe it's my time to start this next phase, and software development is my next challenge. 

Please join with me on this journey!
